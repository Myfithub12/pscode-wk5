Exercise 1

1. We prompt the user to input the first number and store it in the variable num1.
2. We prompt the user to input the second number and store it in the variable num2.
3. We prompt the user to input the second number and store it in the variable num2.
4. We output the value of sum, which represents the sum of the two numbers.


Exercise 2

1. We prompt the user to input a number and store it in the variable num.
2. We use the modulo operator % to check if num divided by 2 has a remainder of 0. If the remainder is 0, it means the number is even.
3. If the condition in step 2 is true, we output the message "The number is even".
4. If the condition in step 2 is false, it means the number is odd.
5. In that case, we output the message "The number is odd".



Exercise 3

1. We initialize a variable called sum to 0. This variable will store the sum of the five numbers.
2. We set minNum to infinity and maxNum to -infinity. These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum numbers encountered.
3. We use a loop to iterate five times since we want to read in five numbers.
4. Within the loop, we prompt the user to input a number and store it in the variable num.
5. We add num to the sum variable to calculate the sum of the numbers.
6. We check if num is less than the current minimum number (minNum). If it is, we update minNum to num.
7. We check if num is greater than the current maximum number (maxNum). If it is, we update maxNum to num.
8. The loop repeats until we have read in five numbers.
9. We calculate the average by dividing the sum by 5 and store it in the variable average.
10. We output the average with an appropriate message.
11. We output the smallest number with an appropriate message.
12. We output the largest number with an appropriate message.
